# Explainable-Credit-Risk-Modeling
This project demonstrates how explainable AI and machine learning can be used to build transparent credit risk models that satisfy regulatory requirements under Basel III, IFRS 9, and OSFI's E-23 guidelines. The framework provides comprehensive model interpretability using SHAP and LIME.
